            <h3> I have been running competitively for 4 years but my love for running started much before that</h3>
            <h3> In 2020 I joined my first track team called mercury track led by my coach Tony Glover </h3>
            <h3> Tony became my inspiration, he encouraged me to work harder and shaped who I am today</h3>
            <h3> Last year I joined my school tack team and had the opportunity run varsity as a freshman</h3>
            <h3> I run the 100-meter dash and the 200 meters and am a part of multiple relay teams</h3>
            <h3> Running is something I love very much and is hopefully something I can do my whole life!</h3>
