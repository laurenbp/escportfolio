            <h3> Track</h3>
            <h5> I have been running competitively for 4 years but my love for running started much before that</h5>
            <h5> In 2020 I joined my first track team called Mercury Track led by my coach Tony Glover </h5>
            <h5> Tony became my inspiration, he encouraged me to work harder and shaped who I am today</h5>
            <h5> Last year I joined my school track team and had the opportunity to run varsity as a freshman</h5>
            <h5> I run the 100-meter dash and the 200 meters and am a part of multiple relay teams</h5>
            <h5> Running is something I love very much and is hopefully something I can do my whole life!</h5>
